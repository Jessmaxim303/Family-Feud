# Blood Dome Fued - Turing Mod 2 Project

A spin-off of family fued that pits two players against one another anwering survey questions to win the most points.

## How it works

How to play:
Must have two players with three rounds.
The players will be in a face-off with the survey above the game board.
Each player starts with a score of 0 and alternates turns responding to the current survey
In the first two rounds, players will take turns guessing responses to the survey. The round is over when all responses to the survey have been guessed
The third round is a "Fast Money" round: each player gets 30 seconds to enter as many responses as they can think of
The winner is determined by the player with the highest total score at the end of three rounds
Good luck!
